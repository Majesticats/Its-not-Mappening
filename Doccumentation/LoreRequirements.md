#Imber

##Overview: 
Imber part will have a rainy environment. The humidity will be too high. Players must be very careful while navigating as paths are slippery. Imber will have two locations. The Sunken Village and the Thunder Path: 
The Sunken Village: A forgotten settlement built on a wide shelf inside the rain cave. The 15–20 homes are carved directly into the cave walls. Most are deserted, still dripping with moisture. Wooden bridges hang over bottomless pits where rainwater gathers.
The Thunder Path: A steep spiraling cave-path heading upward. Small cave-shops and stone-hut shelters sit along the route. The ground is dangerously slippery because waterfalls constantly drip from cracks in the ceiling.

##History and Lore: 
Deep beneath the mountain range lies Imber, a vast subterranean chamber where the ceiling disappears into darkness. Over thousands of years, moisture rising from geothermal vents condensed along the cavern roof, forming cloud layers that behave exactly like those in the outside world. These underground clouds generate constant rainfall, thunder, and distant echoes that shake the stone walls. Early Sherpa explorers believed this place was alive and a sacred “breathing cave” connected to the spirit of the mountain itself. The first settlers carved homes directly into the dripping limestone walls, forming the Rain Village. Life was difficult but peaceful, until unexplained disappearances began. Villagers spoke of shadowed figures walking during lightning flashes and the sound of hooves clattering on stone even when no one was there. One by one, homes were abandoned. Only a few stubborn families remain, tending to dim lanterns while refusing to speak of what happened. Ancient carvings discovered in the deeper tunnels describe a mythical guardian that protects the upper caverns. According to legend, a powerful half-beast creature was bound to safeguard the mountain’s hidden path. Those who attempt to climb the Thunder Path without proving themselves encounter storms far stronger than nature and never return.

##Creatures:
Centaur Guardian (Cave Variant)
A half-beast protector created from ancient cave magic. Instead of a horse body, it has the lower body of a massive mountain goat adapted for climbing cliffs.
Shadow Bats / Minions
Bat-like creatures made of fog and dark moisture, emerging from cracks when the thunder echoes.

#The Craiglands

##Overview
The Craglands are a massive underground cavern filled with jagged rock formations that rise like stone forests. The ground is uneven, sharp, and dangerous, with echoing chambers that distort sound and make navigation confusing. Water drips constantly from unseen cracks, forming slippery pathways and hidden pits. The area is dominated by Driders and other cave-dwelling creatures that have adapted to the harsh, rocky terrain. The main points of interest are The Webcove, a crater wrapped in glowing webs, and Slicksyr, a smooth hill made treacherous by nonstop dripping water. The Craglands feel alive, hostile, and unpredictable and a place where shadows move before you do.

##Lore
The Craglands lie in the mid-depth of the mountain’s cave system, a sprawling network of jagged stone pillars and fractured tunnels that resemble a broken kingdom carved by nature. Long ago, this region served as a refuge for exiles who fled deeper underground to escape surface conflicts. These outcasts created hidden shelters and carved settlements into the sharp stone walls, the largest of which became known as “The Burro”, a cramped but thriving underground commune. Over generations, the Craglands changed. Strange mineral energy seeped from deep fractures in the earth, warping the environment and the creatures living within it. Ordinary cave spiders grew monstrous, eventually transforming into Driders which is half-human, half-spider beings feared by all who wander the tunnels. Their luminous webs spread through the caverns like veins, marking territories that even seasoned explorers avoid. When the exiled settlers began vanishing, the remaining communities collapsed, leaving behind only abandoned tools and faint carvings that hint at their final days. Today, the Craglands are ruled by Driders and stalked by Idwer, small goblin-like climbers who navigate the vertical terrain with ease. Every echo in the Craglands feels like a warning, and every shadow suggests that something is watching from just beyond the torchlight.

##Creatures:
Idwer
Small, goblin-like cave dwellers are known for their agility and intelligence. They cling to walls and ceilings with ease, often observing travelers from above. Although not openly hostile, they can become dangerous when threatened or when Driders are nearby.
Driders
Half-human, half-spider creatures that dominate the Craglands. Their glowing webs stretch across tunnels, cliffs, and cavern ceilings, creating traps and barriers. Driders move silently, strike quickly, and use their webs to detect vibrations from far away.

#Helicon
##Overview: 
Helicon is the deepest and darkest cave system in the mountain, a labyrinth where natural light cannot reach. The air is cold and still, and the only illumination comes from ancient glowing minerals used to fuel the mystery torch. Narrow tunnels branch into puzzle-filled chambers marked with strange symbols left by long-lost Sherpa guides. The deeper a player travels, the more they feel the presence of something watching from the shadows. Helicon ends in the Throne of Bones, home to the corrupted Skeleton King, whose dark magic animates the endless skeleton army guarding the final passage.

##History and Lore:
Helicon lies at the deepest point of the mountain’s cave network, a region where all light is swallowed by ancient stone. Long before the first settlements of Imber and the Craglands were formed, Helicon served as a sacred burial ground for Sherpa elders. These early guides believed the mountain’s heart was a gateway between the living and the spiritual world, and they carved symbols along the walls to mark paths only the worthy could walk. Over centuries, explorers ventured into Helicon seeking forgotten wisdom. Few returned. Whispered accounts spoke of shifting tunnels, runes that changed when unobserved, and voices echoing from behind sealed stone doors. When a respected Sherpa leader vanished during an expedition, the survivors believed he had become trapped in the mountain’s “silent layer,” a realm where time and darkness twisted the mind. They were not wrong. Deep inside Helicon, corrupted chaos magic fused with the lost Sherpa’s spirit, transforming him into the Skeleton King. His despair spread like a sickness, animating the bones of long-dead explorers and guardians. Today, Helicon is a place of puzzles, illusions, and relentless undead. Each symbol carved into its walls is both a clue and a warning: “Only those who respect the mountain’s secrets may leave Helicon alive”.

##Creatures:
Skeleton King
A once-honored Sherpa leader twisted by ancient chaos magic. Now a towering skeletal figure with glowing eyes, he rules Helicon’s deepest chamber. He controls the undead through runes carved into the stone and serves as the final guardian of the mountain’s secrets.
Skeleton Army
Reanimated bones of explorers and Sherpas who died in Helicon. They patrol tunnels in groups, reacting to sound and movement. Some walk, some crawl on walls, and all are bound to the Skeleton King’s chaos energy.
