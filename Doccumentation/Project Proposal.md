## Project Overview

Finding the designated building and going from one building to another can be pretty challenging for new and first year students. The google maps are not updated for a significant amount of time. Specially we don't see many new structures in the current map and some building don't have their numbers on them.

Our project proposes to develop an interactive 2D map of VIU that will allow users to select routes based on acceicbilty and speed. Anyone with a smartphone and internet connection will be able to use the website. The end goal is to create a user friendly 2D navigation system that will improve anyone's experience in VIU. 

## Target audience and motivation 
Our target audience are the students and faculty of VIU. 
The primary motivation behind making this navigation system is we want to make campus life easier and more accessible.
We hope to help everyone with their accessibility needs and efficient in their stay on campus.

## Key features and discussion
Our system will include a 2D interactive map of VIU that will help students and visiors to naviagte inside VIU. Users will be able to search for buildings and facilities and receive direction optimized for accesibility and speed.

## Scaling options
Initially, the project will be limited to the VIU campus, but the design will support scaling to other universities or institutions. By keeping the architecture modular, additional campuses can be added without reworking the entire system. Future scaling may include 3D map, indoor navigation for buildings, and the ability to handle real-time updates such as clousers for construction. 

### Core aspects
- Interactive 2d campus map with search and navigation
- Route planning based on accesibility and speed
- Support for mobile and desktop browsers
- Simple and user friendly interface

### Secondary features
- Points of interest (cafeteria, library, washrooms, parking)
- Ability to bookmark frequently visited locations
- Feedback system for reporting errors or suggesting improvements
- Events marking(avoiding or attending events on campus)

### Stretch goals
- making the map 3D.
- Navigation inside buildings. 
- Making cool designs and allowing for dark mode and light mode customization.
- Login system to save and protect your course schedule and other information(for now it will be no login and if you refresh the page you will have to put your schedule in again)

  
## Risks and potential issues
- The geolocation of the user to allow us to direct them properly
- Putting together the Map and the schedule system together
- The massive possibilities with accessibility which have to be mapped by actually travelling through campus
- Having the system work with both desktop and mobile usage, possibility making it work as an app
