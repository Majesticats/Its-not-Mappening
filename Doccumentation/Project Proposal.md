## Project Overview

Finding the designated building and going from one building to another can be pretty challenging for new and first year students. The google maps are not updated for a significant amount of time. Specially we don't see many new structures in the current map and some building don't have their numbers on them.

Our project proposes to develop an interactive 2D map of VIU that will allow users to select routes based on acceicbilty and speed. Anyone with a smartphone and internet connection will be able to use the website. The end goal is to create a user friendly 2D navigation system that will improve anyone's experience in VIU. 

## Target audience and motivation 

Our target audience are mainly students. 

The primary motivation behind making this navigation system is we want to make every students campus life easier and more accessible. 

## Key features and discussion

Our system will include a 2D interactive map of VIU that will help students and visiors to naviagte inside VIU. Users will be able to search for buildings and facilities and receive direction optimized for accesibility and speed.

## Scaling options
Initially, the project will be limited to the VIU campus, but the design will support scaling to other universities or institutions. By keeping the architecture modular, additional campuses can be added without reworking the entire system. Future scaling may include 3D map, indoor navigation for buildings, and the ability to handle real-time updates such as clousers for construction. 

### Core aspects
- Interactive 2d campus map with search and navigation
- Route planning based on accesibility and speed
- Support for mobile and desktop browsers
- Simple and user friendly interface

### Secondary features
- Points of interest (cafeteria, library, washrooms, parking)
- Ability to bookmark frequently visited locations
- Feedback system for reporting errors or suggesting improvements

### Stretch goals
- making the map 3D.
- Navigation inside buildings. 
- Make the system usbale without internet.
  
## Risks and potential issues
The main risk will be the accuracy of data. If the information is not updated timlely it will lose users. Another big challenge is implementing accesible routes and ensuring the the map is running without any performance issue. finally one last issue is attracting new users. People who are already using Goggle Map, we have convince them to use our system.
