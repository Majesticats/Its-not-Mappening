## Project Overview

Finding the designated building and going from one building to another can be pretty challenging for new and first year students. The google maps are not updated for a significant amount of time. Specially we don't see many new structures in the current map and some building don't have their numbers on them.

Our project proposes to develop an interactive 2D map of VIU that will allow users to select routes based on acceicbilty and speed. Anyone with a smartphone and internet connection will be able to use the website. The end goal is to create a user friendly 2D navigation system that will improve anyone's experience in VIU. 

## Target audience and motivation 

Our target audience are mainly students. 

The primary motivation behind making this navigation system is we want to make every students campus life easier and more accessible.
