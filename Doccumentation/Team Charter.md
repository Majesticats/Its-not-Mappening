## Project intro

The pain of a first year, figuring our routes and the sub par map given to us by VIU, why can we not map ourselves through the university so it gives us the most accessible. the fastest route and maybe even the most scenic route.

We plan to make a map of VIU with information on staircount, elevation and accessibility. We hope to start out with a 2-D map and transition to making a 3-D map with features of a searchbar to choose starting location and the destination. We hope to add a recentre option and an option to choose mode of transport, between walking, wheelchairs or bike.


## Team philosophy

We as a team wanted to help the people around us, making life a little easier or a bit more efficient. We wanted to make a service to help make your very day a bit easier, you might find a faster route than the one you take everyday or just a scenic path that you didn't even know existed.

By making a map to show elevation we can help people prepare for a daunting set of stairs or a great incline on a slope, people in wheelchairs can find the most accessible route to make life a little easier, because instead of exploring and reading signs everywhere they can simply check the website/app and it will map them to their destination with utmost ease. This will help all of us also, better our programming skills, our design skills and understanding and also help us with 3-D design which is a great niche to have.



## Team roles/responsibilities

We are working under a one-leader system with Bruce as the team lead. The conversations will be democratic, however, if a consensus cannot be reached, Bruce will make the final choice. It is to be a democratic autocracy.

Everyone is allowed to raise their concern and suggestions and is encouraged to speak up within group discussions and meetings. We have decided to meet in person on friday's before the lab class for an hour. 

The team would meet in a designated location set up by Bruce every Friday of the week, for at least an hour. The first few minutes of the meeting is to be spent discussing upcoming presentations and our past progress on the project. Then the rest would be spent discussing what is in the future of our project and what we need to complete along with catching up.

The roles will be listed as follows:

- Alex:
  * Programmer
  * Visual Effects support

- Bruce:
  * Doccumentation
  * Presentation 
 
 - Gowan:
  - Visual effects
  - Programmer
 
 - Max:
   * Programmer
   * Mathematician
 
 - Nabil:
   * Programmer
   * Doccumentation

 - Victor​

Any secondary tasks like support or preparing deliverables would be given to the Team Leader would assign to or if someone would volunteer. We will respect time outside the project's scope and another course schedule as well.
