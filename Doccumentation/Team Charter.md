## Project intro
##
The pain of a first year, figuring our routes and the sub par map given to us by VIU, why can we not map ourselves through the university so it gives us the most accessible. the fastest route and maybe even the most scenic route.

We plan to make a map of VIU with information on staircount, elevation and accessibility. We hope to start out with a 2-D map and transition to making a 3-D map with features of a searchbar to choose starting location and the destination. We hope to add a recentre option and an option to choose mode of transport, between walking, wheelchairs or bike.


## Team philosophy

## Team roles/responsibilities
##

We are working under a one-leader system with Bruce as the team lead. The conversations will be democratic, however, if a consensus cannot be reached, Bruce will make the final choice.

Everyone is allowed to raise their concern and suggestions and is encouraged to speak up within group discussions and meetings. We have decided to meet in person on friday's before the lab class for an hour. 

The team would meet in a designated location set up by Bruce every Friday of the week, for at least an hour. The first few minutes of the meeting is to be spent discussing upcoming presentations and our past progress on the project. Then the rest would be spent discussing what is in the future of our project and what we need to complete along with catching up.

The roles will be listed as follows:

 - Alex:​
  - Programmer
  - Visual Effects support

 - Bruce:​
  - Doccumentation
