## 1. <a name="section1"> Known issues/omissions </a>

The entire Idea in essence has completely changed in the course of a single week and so has a few issues, such as the extent to which we actually plan to work on the product itself. It is in simple terms unending. We could work on 5 pages or even 50 pages but ofcourse finding a balance of how much to do within the semester and not neglect other courses or commitments is an issue that can be tough to tackle.

We completely ommitted making a VIU map and decided to make a lore/puzzle/tell tale game which allows you to explore a fantasy land.

## 2. Product Overview <a name="section2"></a>

*Insert name*  is a simple lore website, explore the  caves and find out about the magical and mystical nature of these caves. Find out about the sentient Flora and Fauna, the demons and saints. Go through the caves deeper or higher making your way through to find friends and foes with no real end in sight. Are you trying to venture deep into the cave or find an exit to finally escape, come and find out.

While interacting with the cave you will come across minigames that may include Sudoku, minesweeper, Snake or even riddles. You might find some questions about previously read lore or even fight a big bad boss. You might have some tools to help you in your journey like a journal, calculator or even objects in the world like a pickaxe and dynamite.


## 3. Target audience and motivation <a name="section3"></a>

We target people like us, with the motivation of an escape from the real world into a fun fiction to read and play through. We want to make this for big nerds, people that like DND, Skyrim and other RPGs where you immerse yourself in a new world.

## 4. flow, objectives, and plot-line <a name="section4"></a>

The flow is non-linear where you can choose your path or even retrace your steps to go and find a different path. The journey through the cave with minigames and puzzles, there is no true objective because the whole point is making your own story where you go through the cave to find the secrets and powers that lie within. 

The plot is quite simple with the user going through the cave on their adventure with their aim simply to adventure.

## 5. Key features, with detailed requirements for each <a name="section5"></a>

## 7. Feature prioritization <a name="section7"></a>

As this is our first attempt at web design and development there is a great deal of uncertainty around what we'll be able to successfully complete.

As a result, we have identified a core set of features we absolutely want to complete, a secondary set that we certainly hope to complete, and a set of stretch goals we can work on if/when everything else is finished.

### Core aspects
The following must all be implemented for us to regard the project as a success:
- A Main Landing Page 
- Complete 9 Story Pages spanning three environments with each environment having two seperate locations within
- Tic Tac Toe Minigame
- Sudoku Minigame
- Memory Minigame
- Riddles
- Lore Questions
- Journal as a tool

### Secondary features
The following are features we hope to implement, but on an "as time permits" basis:
- Minesweeper Minigame
- Snake Minigame
- Tools and usage such as a calculator, pickaxe or dynamite.

### Stretch goals
The following features are not expected to make it into our initial version of the game, but would be nice to add if things proceed smoothly and ahead of schedule:
- Multiple versions of the story such as a Cave Diving Expedition, A forest adventure or Magical Castle Escape.
- Customization of your character(If we make a character Model)
- Monetization model

## 8. Non-functional requirements <a name="section8"></a>

The website should provide a smooth and responsive experience across common web browsers and screen sizes, ensuring consistent functionality on both desktop and mobile devices. Performance is key — pages and minigames should load quickly, with minimal latency between transitions to maintain immersion. 
The interface should be intuitive and visually cohesive, with clear navigation and readable text to support long reading.
He system should be reliable, maintaining user progress (such as journal entries or puzzle completions) during a session, and be easily maintainable with modular, well-documented code to allow future feature additions.(cookies) 
The overall design should evoke a sense of mystery and fantasy while maintaining usability and performance standards expected of a modern web experience.

## 9. Glossary <a name="section9"></a>

*Known omission:* - the actual glossary content is yet to be determined.
