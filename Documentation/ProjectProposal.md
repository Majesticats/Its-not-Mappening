### Project Overview

The Endless Chasm is a narrative-driven lore exploration game presented as an interactive website experience. Players traverse a vast supernatural cave world where reality is uncertain, the depth is infinite, and the path is non-linear. 

Players decide how they navigate wandering endlessly through branching chambers and tunnels. Throughout the journey the user will encounter skill-based mini-games, and interactive lore. There is no final prescribed ending — the experience is designed to let the player shape their own narrative direction.

This project focuses on immersion, lore depth, and open-ended discovery, rather than a fixed linear end-state. It is intended to be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without external front-end frameworks, minimizing tool overhead and ensuring development feasibility within the semester.

### Target Audience and Motivation

The Endless Chasm is intended for players who enjoy immersive narrative exploration and world-building, in particular individuals who enjoy fantasy fiction, role-playing environments, and puzzle-solving. Players who are fans of Dungeons & Dragons, Skyrim, text adventures, and choice-driven RPG storytelling formats are likely to find this experience engaging.

Our motivation is to provide an escapist interactive world that offers a break from everyday real-world stress, academic pressure, and structured tasks. It is meant for individuals like us who want to explore a fictional alternate universe at their own pace reading, analyzing, solving, and shaping their own path as they uncover secrets buried within the caves.

### Key Features and Discussion

#### Lore System

- Players will see descriptive narrative elements presented with visual images representing:
    
    - Locations within the cave world
        
    - Characters encountered along routes
        
    - Creatures, both hostile and neutral
        
- Descriptions will include:
    
    - Core story elements and narrative reveals
        
    - Flavour text for thematic immersion and mood building
        
    - World history, ancient mythology, and contextual world-building
        
- Story elements are intended to be discovered progressively and non-linearly, allowing players to construct their own interpretation of the world’s meaning and origins.

#### Non-linear Exploration

- Users choose direction freely, with branching paths and the ability to retrace steps.
- There is no defined primary objective or required storyline path.
- Player choice influences their experience, knowledge gained, and how the cave evolves for them.
#### Tools and World Interaction

*  Certain locations/pages will provide access to tools that support puzzle-solving or progression.
    
- Potential tools include: journal, calculator, pickaxe, dynamite, or other interactable objects.
    
- Tools may be required to overcome challenges or solve mini-game gates in deeper cave sections.
#### Mini-Games

All puzzle systems will be implemented by the development team using custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript. A range of selectable mini-games are used for progression and challenge elements:
- Sudoku 
- Tic-tac-toe
- Riddles and problem-solving prompts
- Lore-based quiz questions to verify retained knowledge

Mini-games support pacing changes between reading, exploring, and solving — adding skill-based interactivity that complements narrative immersion.

### Preliminary Interface Sketches
Mock-ups of the main website page and some of the menus are shown below, though these are to be treated as *very* preliminary and will certainly change as we get deeper into the design process.

### Scaling and Stretch Goals (Clarification Additions)

- Collectible pages of lore are considered a **stretch goal**, where players may optionally collect discoverable fragments of ancient history, recorded notes, or hidden world documentation as optional long-form progression rewards.
    
- These collectibles would be beyond the minimum viable scope and only implemented if core systems are completed and remaining development time permits.
### Risks, Limitations, and Concerns

Due to the conceptual scale of a world with potentially infinite expansion, there is significant risk related to scope management. The concept can expand endlessly, making it challenging to define a limit. Ensuring deliverables remain realistic while not sacrificing creative direction is a balancing challenge.

Additionally, the conceptual shift from the earlier VIU campus map idea to this fantasy exploration concept introduces potential redesign overhead. The team will need to commit to strong scope control and focus on core feature implementation, while leaving extension content for post-semester or stretch goal phases.
