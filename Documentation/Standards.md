# CSCI 265 Team Standards and Processes (Phase 2)

## Team name: Not Mappening

## Project/product name: Cavedivers 

## Key contact person and email

 - Bruce Fernandes, bruce2005.ind@gmail.com *main contact*

## Document structure

In this document we will be addressing three core areas of standards and processes:
 - Documentation standards and processes
 - Coding standards and processes
 - Version control standards and processes

Each section includes discussion of how those standards/processes will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for potential updates if/as needed.

## Documentation standards and processes

Documentation is done by Bruce who is our Document manager as such there will be internal cohesion and continuity among all the documents. We will follow the .md format as stated in https://www.markdownguide.org and otherwise following the same file structure as given by Professor David Wessels.

## Coding standards and processes

We will all be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for all the coding and usage of the website. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be used in their regular syntax and otherwise will be done using https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp for the HTML and CSS syntax and standards and https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json.asp for the standards of our JavaScript work. If required we will be using some elements of C++ in the website for some backend development

## Version control standards and processes

Version control and Github usage will be streamlined and simple, the main branch will be the actual website and the most usable version.
There will be seperate branches for each member of the team to work on. whenever working on the repo each member should pull the main branch to their named branch to make sure they are working in the most up to date version of the repo. Nobody is to push their named branch into the main branch at any point except the Version control manager. The seperate branch must be checked and tested before merging with the main branch to avoid breaking the repo. Only the version control manager can merge the named branch into the main branch after being checked by the named branch member and the version control manager as well.
