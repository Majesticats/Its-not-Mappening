## Project intro

Our team is developing _The Endless Chasm_, a single-player interactive narrative exploration game delivered as a website. It combines worldbuilding, progressive lore discovery, and custom  mini-games to create an immersive experience where the player explores a supernatural cave system with no fixed ending. As players navigate through branching pathways, they will uncover strange entities, ancient history, and narrative artifacts that reveal the mysteries of the cave world. The design emphasizes open-ended exploration, subtle storytelling, and player-driven direction. This project allows us to learn and apply front-end development, interactive system design, and narrative structuring while building a creative, unique, and technically feasible game experience within the semester.

## Team philosophy

As a team, we prioritize balanced creativity, technical feasibility, and consistent collaboration. Our philosophy is to build a world that invites curiosity and imagination while committing to realistic, achievable milestones. We value communication, mutual support, and shared responsibility so that each member contributes in both creative and technical dimensions.
Our collective goal is to give each team member space to learn, grow, and strengthen their development skills and to deliver a final product we are proud of both artistically and academically.

## Team roles/responsibilities

We are working under a one-leader system with Bruce as the team lead. The conversations will be democratic, however, if a consensus cannot be reached, Bruce will make the final choice. It is to be a democratic autocracy.
Everyone is allowed to raise their concern and suggestions and is encouraged to speak up within group discussions and meetings. We have decided to meet in person on Friday's before the lab class for an hour.
The team would meet in a designated location set up by Bruce every Friday of the week, for at least an hour. The first few minutes of the meeting is to be spent discussing upcoming presentations and our past progress on the project. Then the rest would be spent discussing what is in the future of our project and what we need to complete along with catching up.

The roles will be listed as follows:
#### Gowan - Lead Narrative Designer & Integration Coordinator
* Oversees visual direction, narrative coherence, and world representation
- Creates visual assets and organizes page flow
- Maintains structural consistency between story content, UI layout and feature integration

#### Bruce - Communication Lead & Documentation Specialist
- Responsible for producing, maintaining, and organizing formal project documentation including proposals, reports, design specs, and final write-ups.
- Leads project communication deliverables such as presentations and demos. 

#### Nabil - Narrative Content Developer
* Responsible for writing major lore segments and story script components

#### Victor -  Assistant  Designer & User Experience Developer
* Responsible for ensuring the website interface is intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly.
* Contributes to front-end UI design decisions, navigation flow feedback, and overall site usability.

#### Max - Feature Interaction Developer
* Responsible for tool-based interactive game features such as the in-game journal system, and additional tool feature development

## Planned team meeting time(s) and communication plans

The team is to meet on Friday at 10am before the lab, we are to discuss the presentation or quiz, depending on what we have to do that day and finalize any presentation work or discuss our quiz cheat-sheets. This meeting will be held in the library depending on the consensus of the members at the time. Any extra meeting must be scheduled atleast 16 hours before the meeting time and quorum of atleast 3 members must be met meetings of this sort can be conducted on discord or in person. All our communication is to be done on Discord in the "The Mappening" discord group channel.

## Deadlines and Deliverables

Team members will volunteer to do tasks that fall into their skills and expertise. General documentation tasks are to be done by Bruce. Organization will be shared by the version control head and the team lead. If a deadline is unmet or undeliverable for whatever reason there will be a discussion between project organization and the team member involved and an appropriate resolution will be found.

## Conflict resolution scheme

Conflicts will be decided democratically, however if a consensus is not met then the team leader will decide on the resolution by themself. If at any point the team leader is not accepted by all other members, the leader will have to step down and another leader will be democratically elected.
If any conflicts cannot be resolved among the team, we will approach Professor David Wessels to resolve the conflict. Any issues and concerns will be brought up during Friday's meeting.

## AI Policy

* None of the projects code or assets are to be generated with AI.​
* Using AI for non-generative purposes, investigatory, learning, etc., is each individual team member's prerogative. Otherwise we will be following the VIU academic code of conduct for our AI policy.

## Intellectual property rights

All members will retain rights to what content they create. Content that is created by multiple people will be the property of all members involved.
The team are welcome to have this program in their portfolios but no other use of the code and program are allowed to be used for any purpose without the consent of all the members.

## Discussion of team strengths/weaknesses

The group all have experience in programming and coding before and are able to collaborate in groups An overall breakdown of the team's strengths are listed below:
* **Bruce** is a programmer with experience in Java, C++ and operating systems. He is also good at public speaking and has theatre experience.
* **Gowan** is an avid programmer with experience in multiple languages and design and will therefore be working on the design for our website.
* **Max** is a mathematician and programmer and is happy to work on code and logic.
* **Nabil**
* **Victor** is great at design and programming and so will be working on front end of the website.

On the other hand, the team's lacking are as follows:
* There is an overall lack of experience in a team environment by most of the team and so we have to adapt to each other.
* Bruce is quite talkative and can completely derail the conversation with YAP.

In conclusion, we are taking each step carefully to not let anyone go beyond their skills and capabilities which might make a team feel overwhelmed or burned out.
