            <h2>Helicon Overview</h2>
            <p>Helicon is the deepest and darkest cave system in the mountain, a twisting labyrinth where natural light never reaches. The air is cold and unnaturally still, swallowing every sound a moment after it’s made.</p>
            <p>Faint illumination comes from ancient glowing minerals embedded in the rock and harvested to fuel mysterious torches. Narrow tunnels branch into puzzle-filled chambers marked with strange symbols left by long-lost Sherpa guides.</p>
            <p>The farther a traveller descends, the stronger the feeling that something is watching from just beyond the edge of the torchlight. All paths eventually converge on the Throne of Bones, where the corrupted Skeleton King and his endless army guard the final passage out of the mountain.</p>

            <h2>History of the Silent Depths</h2>
            <p>Long before settlements formed in Imber or the Craglands, Helicon was used as a sacred burial ground for Sherpa elders. They believed the mountain’s heart was a gateway between the living world and the spirits that guided travellers.</p>
            <p>To protect these paths, the elders carved guiding runes along the walls—symbols meant to be read only by those who respected the mountain. Over centuries, explorers entered Helicon seeking forgotten wisdom and hidden routes.</p>
            <p>Few returned. Survivors spoke of tunnels that shifted when unobserved, markings that changed shape, and distant voices echoing behind sealed stone doors. One famed Sherpa leader vanished here, said to be trapped in a “silent layer” of reality where time and darkness twist together.</p>

          <!-- The Skeleton King's Realm -->
          <article class="panel">
            <h2>The Skeleton King’s Realm</h2>
            <p>Deep within Helicon, wild chaos magic seeped through the stone and bound itself to the lost Sherpa leader’s spirit. His devotion to guarding the mountain curdled into despair, and he was reborn as the Skeleton King.</p>
            <p>His corrupted will spread through the burial chambers, animating the bones of fallen explorers and Sherpa guardians. These skeletal soldiers patrol Helicon’s tunnels in tireless patrols—some walking upright, others crawling along walls and ceilings.</p>
            <p>Runes carved into the stone now serve the Skeleton King, letting him command his army and reshape parts of the cave. Every symbol in Helicon has become both a clue and a warning: only those who respect the mountain’s secrets will ever leave this place alive.</p>
