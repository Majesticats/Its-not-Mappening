          <h2>Throne of Bones</h2>
          <p>At the deepest point of Helicon lies the Skeleton King’s chamber, a vast hall carved from ancient stone and layered with countless bones. Skulls are stacked into crude pillars, and ribcages form twisted arches above a cracked stone dais.</p>
          <p>The Skeleton King himself was once a revered Sherpa leader, lost to the mountain’s darkness. Chaos magic fused with his spirit, twisting his duty to protect travellers into a relentless desire to test and punish them.</p>
          <p>Every movement he makes stirs the chamber; loose bones rattle, empty eye sockets turn, and the air hums with the magic that binds his skeletal army to his will.</p>

          <h2>The King’s Final Test</h2>
          <p>Arranged around the throne are slabs of stone etched with careful patterns—rows and columns of symbols carved so precisely that any disturbance feels wrong. Some markings glow faintly, as if they are waiting to be placed in their proper positions.</p>
          <p>Stories say the Skeleton King no longer tests challengers with strength alone. Those who enter his chamber must prove they can bring order to chaos, restoring balance to a grid of ancient signs before his patience runs out.</p>
          <p>The air feels heavy with expectation, as if the chamber itself is watching to see whether you can read the pattern hidden in the bones.</p>
