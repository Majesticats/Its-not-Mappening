          <h2>The Hill That Never Dries</h2>
          <p>Slicksyr is a smooth stone hill rising from the heart of the Craglands, polished over centuries by dripping water. From a distance it looks harmless—almost inviting compared to the jagged rocks surrounding it.</p>
          <p>Up close, its surface is coated in a thin, constant sheen of moisture that turns every step into a gamble. Tiny rivulets run in strange patterns, tracing winding paths that never seem to repeat.</p>
          <p>For climbers, Slicksyr is both a shortcut and a trap. Reaching the top offers a rare vantage point over the stone “forest” of the Craglands, but one misstep can send a traveler sliding into unseen pits and web-covered ravines below.</p>

          <h2>Echoes on the Slope</h2>
          <p>Many explorers tell stories of trying to cross Slicksyr at speed, only to find their own momentum turning against them. A single slip becomes an uncontrolled slide, boots scraping for purchase while the cavern tilts and spins around them.</p>
          <p>Some claim that the Driders and Idwer watch from the cliffs whenever someone climbs the hill, waiting to see whether the traveler masters the terrain or becomes another echo in the dark. Webbing strands and claw marks near the base suggest not everyone reaches the bottom on their own terms.</p>
          <p>Local guides whisper one piece of advice: never rush on Slicksyr. The hill punishes impatience, but those who move carefully can use its smooth surface to glide into hidden paths the Craglands keeps from the careless.</p>
