          <h2>Craglands Overview</h2>
          <p>The Craglands are a massive underground cavern where jagged rock formations rise like a forest of stone. The ground is uneven and sharp, forcing every step to be deliberate.</p>
          <p>Water drips constantly from unseen cracks, turning narrow paths slick and filling hidden pits that lurk just beyond the light. Echoes bounce between the pillars, twisting sound so that danger is hard to place.</p>
          <p>This hostile region is home to Driders and other cave-dwelling creatures that have adapted to the harsh terrain, making the Craglands feel alive, watching, and always one misstep away from disaster.</p>

          <h2>The Burrow and the Lost Refuge</h2>
          <p>Long ago, the Craglands served as a refuge for exiles who fled deeper underground to escape surface conflicts. They carved cramped shelters into the sharp walls and linked them with narrow ledges and rope bridges.</p>
          <p>The largest of these hidden settlements became known as “The Burrow,” a crowded but thriving commune tucked between towering pillars. Tools, carvings, and faded markings still cling to the rock, hinting at a community that once struggled to build a life in the dark.</p>
          <p>Over time, strange mineral energies seeped up from deep fractures in the earth. The environment warped, and the creatures that lived here changed with it. As the Craglands grew more dangerous, the exiles began to vanish, leaving The Burrow empty and silent.</p>

        <article class="panel">
          <h2>The Webcove and Drider Domain</h2>
          <p>At the heart of the Craglands lies the Webcove, a crater wrapped in glowing webs that pulse faintly like veins of light. The air there feels thick, and every surface carries the sticky trace of silk.</p>
          <p>This region is ruled by Driders—half-human, half-spider beings that move silently across cliffs and ceilings. Their luminous webs stretch over tunnels and chasms, forming traps and boundaries that even seasoned explorers hesitate to cross.</p>
          <p>Small goblin-like Idwer scurry along the stone, using their climbing skills to navigate the vertical terrain. Some watch travelers from above, deciding whether to remain unseen or lead them deeper into Drider territory.</p>
