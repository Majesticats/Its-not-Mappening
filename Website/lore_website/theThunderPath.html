          <h2>Stairway Through the Storm</h2>
          <p>The Thunder Path is a steep, spiraling route carved into the inner walls of Imber’s rain-soaked cavern. It climbs along the rock like a broken staircase, hugging cliffs and weaving between waterfalls that crash from the ceiling above.</p>
          <p>Small cave-shops and stone shelters cling to the edges of the trail, remnants of a time when travelers still dared to rest here. Now most are abandoned, their doors hanging open, lantern hooks empty and dripping.</p>
          <p>Every surface along the Thunder Path is slick with constant runoff. Lightning flashes far overhead, briefly illuminating the climb and casting jagged shadows that make the ascent feel even more treacherous.</p>

          <h2>Footsteps in the Lightning</h2>
          <p>Those who have walked the Thunder Path tell of hearing hooves striking stone just behind them, though nothing is ever there when they turn. During storms, shapes appear for a heartbeat in the lightning—silhouettes of a towering guardian poised on the switchbacks above.</p>
          <p>Legends say this path leads toward the mountain’s upper secrets and that a half-beast protector watches all who attempt the climb. Those who are reckless or disrespectful to the mountain are said to vanish into sudden walls of rain, never reaching the next ledge.</p>
          <p>Guides whisper that the safest way forward is to move steadily, not quickly, and to listen. If the thunder begins to fall in a steady rhythm, like hooves on stone, it means the path has already decided whether you should continue.</p>
